three loss types:
- electrical loss ( I2R )
- core loss (thermal, magnetization)
- mechanical loss (friction, rotational) 

  

1. force on wire in presence of a magnetic field
	1. $F = I (L \times B)$
	2.  force on wire = current times cross product of length and magnetic field
2.  induced voltage on a wire that moves through a magnetic field
	1.  $e_{ind} = ( V \times B ) \cdot L$
	2.  velocity cross flux density dot length
3.  KVL:
	1.  $V_B - iR - e_{ind} = 0$
4.  Newtonâ€™s Law
	1.  $F = ma$

since starting at rest, $V = 0, e_{ind} = 0$

  

$$i = \frac{V_B - e_{ind}}{R}$$ 
$i = \frac{VB}{R}$ at rest

  

$F_{ind} = iLB$

V increases, eind increases, i decreases

$\mu_0 = 4\pi\times10^{-7} \mathrm{\frac{N}{A^2}}$

$N$: number of turns (turns)
$I$: current (Amp)
$R$: reluctance (1/Henry)
$\phi$: flux (Weber)
$\lambda$: flux linkage (Weber-turn)
$L$: inductance (Henry)

## Flux: $\phi = \frac{NI}{R}$

## Flux linkage: $\lambda = N\phi$

## Coil/Core Inductance: $L = \frac{\lambda}{I}$
